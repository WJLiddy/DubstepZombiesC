c collide.bmp

# define your objects here, use "do" (define object) to define a non-animated object.
# The syntax is:
# name          image                 collide

do vend_south mapobj/vendsouth.png mapobj/vend_c.png

# Then you have animated objects. Use "dao" (define animated object)
# The syntax is:
#   name     collide          animation + frame count (for as many frames as you like)

dao kiosk mapobj/kiosk_c.png mapobj/kiosk_1.png 15 mapobj/kiosk_2.png 45

# Finally, you place objects like this, using p (put)

p vend_south 100 100
p kiosk 150 100
p kiosk 200 200
