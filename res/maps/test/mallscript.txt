# Here, define the map name, using n "name"

n test

a always.png
b base.bmp
c collide.bmp

# define your objects here, use "do" (define object) to define a non-animated object.
# The syntax is:
# name          image                 collide

do vending_south obj/vending_south.bmp obj/vending_south_c.bmp
do vending_west obj/vending_west.bmp obj/vending_west_c.bmp

# Then you have animated objects. Use "dao" (define animated object)
# The syntax is:
#   name     collide          animation + frame count (for as many frames as you like)

dao fountain obj/fountain.bmp obj/f1.bmp 1 obj/f2.bmp 3

# Finally, you place objects like this, using p (put)

p vending_south 500 500
p veding_west 200 200
p fountain 134 352
p fountain 234 192
