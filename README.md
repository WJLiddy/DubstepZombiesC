# I NEED A REFRESHER on C++

This is Dubstep Zombies, a re-imagining of a game Mickey and I wrote in High School. Over the next 4 months, I'd like to finish it up and make it semi-presentable.

You have to hold out against hordes of zombies for several days. Can you win? Probably.

February: Fundamental Combat, Some Characters, Controllers, Sound

March: Enemy and Friendly AI

April: Balancing and Finishing touches, release.

Wanna help? Pls?
We're using allegro 5.

Here's how you install the libs for Allegro (on Ubuntu)

On Windows it's a bit more involved, but not too bad

You can build the project by running build.sh.
