# I NEED A REFRESHER on C++

This is Dubstep Zombies, a game Mickey and I wrote in High School. Over the next 4 months, I'd like to finish it up and make it semi-presentable.

You have to hold out against hordes of dubstep zombies for 7 waves. Can you win? Probably.

January: Basic Gamestate (Title, Options, Main Menu), Map Rendering, 3 Characters, Input (including controllers), Sound

February: Fundamental Combat

March: Enemy and Friendly AI

April: Balancing and Finishing touches, release.
